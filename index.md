## About

Hi! I am Samantha Tsang, currently a pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at MIT Sloan School of Management, with a focus in Machine Learning and Optimization. 

Prior to MIT, I graduated at UCLA with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics. I am experienced in leveraging machine learning methods to drive business decisions in various domains such as marketing, healthcare, and technology. I am passionate about exploring interpretability and mitigation of bias in machine learning models, as well as NLP/LLM applications.
  
I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn and adapt to new tools and technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy completing jigsaw puzzles, building Lego sets, and weightlifting.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

## Non-Internship Projects

## Natural Language Processing

[Movie Reviews Spoiler Detection](https://github.com/samantha-tsang/Movie_Spoiler_Detection)
<br>
The purpose of this project was to develop a system to detect and prevent movie spoilers in user reviews, thereby enhancing the user experience by safeguarding against unwanted plot disclosures. This method utilized bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNN) in a hierarchical structure to capture sequential dependencies between words and sentences. This model also featured an attention layer that created sentence and document representations through a learned weighted average of words and sentences. The system effectively processed over 500K movie reviews, accurately identifying and flagging potential spoilers with an AUC of 77%.

[Yelp Reviews Analysis](https://github.com/samantha-tsang/yelpReviewsAnalysis)
<br>
In this project, I aimed to uncover the most discussed topics in Yelp reviews of restaurants in California and understand their influence on extreme ratings. By utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), I first categorized the reviews into distinct topics. Then, I implemented sentiment analysis to gauge customer sentiment towards these topics and conducted Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to statistically evaluate their impact on extreme ratings. This approach provided actionable insights for restaurant owners to strategically enhance their services based on customer feedback.

## Reinforcement Learning

#### Leveraging LLMs to solve Long Horizon Tasks via Reinforcement Learning
The purpose of this project was to enhance the training of agents for long-horizon tasks by leveraging large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal was to enable agents to break down complex tasks into simpler, sequential sub-tasks, thereby improving their ability to complete intricate objectives composed of skills already known to the agent. We (a team of 2) implemented an LLM pipeline for subgoal generation, where the LLM parsed input prompts to generate ordered sets of subgoals. These subgoals were then used in a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework to train agents in a simulated kitchen environment. This approach demonstrated the potential of integrating LLMs with RL to tackle long-horizon tasks more effectively.

## Optimization

#### Optimized Approach for Cost-Efficient Meal Planning
In this project, we (a team of 2) tackled the challenge of creating a cost-efficient weekly meal plan that meets specific health and nutrition goals. By employing mixed-integer optimization, we developed a method to minimize the cost of meals while ensuring nutritional requirements are satisfied. Our approach reduced meal costs by 71.49% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimization in meal planning.

## Deep Learning

#### Multimodal Approach in Melanoma Detection
In this project, we (a team of 2) aimed to significantly improve early melanoma detection, addressing a critical need as melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. By developing a multimodal neural network that integrates both dermoscopic images and patient metadata, we enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Our model, leveraging a pre-trained VGG-16 for image processing and dense layers for tabular data, achieved an AUC of 0.84, outperforming the baseline CNN model's AUC of 0.79. This approach demonstrates the powerful impact of using multimodal data in medical diagnostics, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate melanoma detection, which is vital for effective treatment.
