## About

Hi! I am Samantha Tsang, currently a pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at MIT Sloan School of Management, with a focus in Machine Learning and Optimization. 

Prior to MIT, I graduated at UCLA with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics. I am experienced in leveraging machine learning methods to drive business decisions in various domains such as marketing, healthcare, and technology. I am passionate about exploring interpretability and mitigation of bias in machine learning models, as well as NLP/LLM applications.
  
I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn and adapt to new tools and technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy completing jigsaw puzzles, building Lego sets, and weightlifting.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
