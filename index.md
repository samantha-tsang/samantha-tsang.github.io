## About

Hi! I am Samantha Tsang, currently a pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at MIT Sloan School of Management, with a focus in Machine Learning and Optimization. 

Prior to MIT, I graduated at UCLA with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics. I am experienced in leveraging machine learning methods to drive business decisions in various domains such as marketing, healthcare, and technology. I am passionate about exploring interpretability and mitigation of bias in machine learning models, as well as NLP/LLM applications.
  
I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn and adapt to new tools and technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy completing jigsaw puzzles, building Lego sets, and weightlifting.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

### Natural Language Processing

[Movie Reviews Spoiler Detection](https://github.com/samantha-tsang/Movie_Spoiler_Detection)
<br>
The purpose of this project was to develop a system to detect and prevent movie spoilers in user reviews, thereby enhancing the user experience by safeguarding against unwanted plot disclosures. This method utilized a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN), which incorporated a Bi-Directional RNN with GRU to capture sequential dependencies between words and sentences. This model also featured an attention layer that created sentence and document representations through a learned weighted average of words and sentences. The system effectively processed over 500K movie reviews, accurately identifying and flagging potential spoilers with an AUC of 77%.
